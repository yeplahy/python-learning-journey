# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository where I document my journey of learning Python from the ground up. This space serves as my digital notebook, containing all the exercises, notes, and mini-projects I complete. The goal is to track my progress and build a strong foundation in programming.

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap & Structure

This repository is organized into modules, each corresponding to a core concept in Python. This structure helps keep the learning process clean and sequential.

*   **📁 [1-Basics](./1-basics/)**: Fundamental concepts like variables, data types, operators, and user input.
*   **📁 [2-Data-Structures](./2-Data-Structures/)**: Exercises on Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets—the building blocks for organizing data.
*   **📁 [3-Control-Flow](./3-Control-Flow/)**: Logic with `if/else` statements, `for` loops, and `while` loops to control the flow of my programs.
*   **📁 [4-Functions](./4-Functions/)**: Learning to build reusable blocks of code with functions, parameters, and return values.
*   **📂 [Projects](./Projects/)**: A dedicated space for small, practical projects where I apply all the concepts I've learned.
